from Tron game group:

In this game, we primarily rely on the eventSystem API. We have our player and collision
hierarchy. The game actually can support "player vs player" and "player vs computer" game
modes. But right now since we didn't make a GUI before the game, we can only support 
"player vs computer" game mode. We also add a simple AI into the game so that the computer
can control its path. We added bonus into the game, when the player hits the yellow bonus,
it can speed up.The level is randomly created. Overall, the game can be improved in the 
future.


Below is what we plan to do next time to improve our game.
1 try to use level system to create the level rather than just create randomlevel.
2 add something like GUI in order for the player to choose game mode such as player vs PC and player vs player. 
3 if possible, enhance the AI
4. use others’ API such as to add overlay system and so on.
