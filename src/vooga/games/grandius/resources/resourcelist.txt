# The ResourceHandler class manages the Images, "Animations", and Sounds which will be
# needed in the game. It maintains a map that connects String labels to String filepaths. 
# When the game initializes its resources, the following code should be executed:
# 
# ResourceHandler.loadFile("resourcelist.txt");
# 
# The following code will access the filepath associated with the given resource label
# "Background":
# 
# ResourceHandler.getMapping("Background");
# 
# Golden T luckily has very strong Image and Animation management, and so the ResourceHandler
# class has been simplified in more recent versions. In Golden T, one should use a call
# such as getImage(ResourceHandler.getMapping("Background")) within the Game class.
#
# Example text file format::
# Resources are put into the ResourceHandler.myMap field as follows:
# *filepath1*,*resource1 name*
# *filepath2*,*resource2 name*
# ...
