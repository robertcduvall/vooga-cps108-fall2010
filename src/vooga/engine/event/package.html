The application which utilizes this event system will be able to help objects to register or listen to a event as well as fire a event when the event is triggered. The event will be automatically fired and received in game loop when the event is triggered. 
</p>
<p>
This Event system primarily includes two classes whose names are <b>EventPool</b> and <b>IEventHandler</b>. IEventHandler is interface while EventPool is an class. 
Every class which implements <code>IEventHandler</code> interface can be added into <code>EventPool</code> for checking the events later in game loop.
Please see the event classes in this package.

Taking Pacman game for example,ghosts, enemies of pacman, are trying to catch pacman in one line and end the game. The
  speed of ghost is faster than pacman. Here is the fire event condition: when the ghost catches 
  up with pacman which indicated by their x position, the pacman will be killed the killevent will 
  be triggered. In this case, we can write a event class such as PacmanKilledEvent.Add it in the
  EventLoop class. And the eventLoop will check the event for you.
