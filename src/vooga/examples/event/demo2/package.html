The example which utilizes the event system will demonstrate how to use the event system which includes how to
 register or listen to an event as well as fire a event when the event is triggered. The event will be automatically 
 fired and received in game loop when the event is triggered. 
</p>
<p>
The Event system the example used primarily includes two classes whose names are <b>EventPool</b> and <b>IEventHandler</b>. IEventHandler is interface while EventPool is an class. 
Every class which implements <code>IEventHandler</code> interface can be added into <code>EventPool</code> for checking the events later in game loop.
Please see the event classes in this package.

  Taking ZombieLand game for example,Strong zombies, enemies of weak human, are trying to catch human in one line and end the game. The
  speed of the zombie is faster than human. Here is the fire event condition: when the zombie catches 
  up with human which indicated by their x position, the human will be killed the killevent will 
  be triggered. In this case, we can write a event class such as HumanKilledbyZombieEvent.Add it in the
  EventLoop class. And the eventLoop will check the event for you.
