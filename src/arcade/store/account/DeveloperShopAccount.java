 * 				2) certify third party (other developers) mods
 * 				3) provide their own mods (should be certified on the go)
 * 				5) NOT have to pay for their own game
 * 				6) Upload games/ mods/ update
 * 				7) Change the content (access to a different GUI)
 * 			
 * 				8) Perks: 	get an amount from developed games...!!! 	
 *							some other perks: if developers sell enough game to customers
 *												they get extra bonus points
