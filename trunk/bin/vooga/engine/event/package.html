The application which utilizes this event system will be able to help objects to register or listen to a event as well as fire a event when the event is triggered. The event will be automatically fired and received by program when the event is triggered. 
<p/>
<p>
This Event system primarily includes three classes whose name are EventManager, IEevent and Listener. IEevent and IEeventListener are two interfaces while EventManager is an abstract class. A class which is designed to listen to a event should implement IEeventListener or implement the interface which extends the IEeventListener.  IEevent will be implemented by the classes which will be designed to be the object that passes as parameter through the event dispatch. EventManager class will be extended by event listener and event dispatcher and it will take care of receiving listener and firing the event to listener when the event is triggered.
</p>
<p>
For example, if A wants to listener to B and the event is triggered when B moves up. A should implements IEeventListener and extends EventManager while B should extends EventManager. A can call A.addIEeventListener to register an event while B can call fireEvent to fire the event to A and A's method actionPerformed(IEevent e) will be invoked.
