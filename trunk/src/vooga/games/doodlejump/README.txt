GAME DESCRIPTION

The game DoodleGame is based on the popular iPhone/Android game Doodle Jump. The main character that the player controls game is "Doodle" and is defined in the DoodleSprite class. A DoodleSprite is constantly falling, unless it lands on a variety of platforms which make Doodle jump up. Doodle can also move left and right to navigate towards platforms and away from obstacles.

There are several types of platforms that appear in DoodleGame. The most basic platform is the Green platform which Doodle can get a slight jump off of. Some Green platforms have a spring or trampoline connected to them which provide a larger jump.

The broken Brown platforms break when Doodle lands on them, providing no jump.

Blue and Gray platforms provide the same amount of jump as a Green platform but Blue platforms move Left and Right and Gray platforms move Up and Down.

White platforms provide the same amount of jump as Green platforms but disappear after Doodle bounces on them once.

The obstacles that appear in DoodleGame are a variety of monsters. The monsters move in various ways and if Doodle hits them the game ends. If Doodle lands on top of a monster the game does not end instead he jumps off of them and the monster disappears. Doodle can also shot a ball from his nose which makes a monster disappear if it hits one.
