The application which utilizes this event system will be able to help objects to register or listen to a event as well as fire a event when the event is triggered. The event will be automatically fired and received in game loop when the event is triggered. 
</p>
<p>
This Event system primarily includes two classes whose names are <b>EventPool</b> and <b>IEventHandler</b>. IEventHandler is interface while EventPool is an class. 
Every class which implements <code>IEventHandler</code> interface can be added into <code>EventPool</code> for checking the events later in game loop.
Please see the event classes in this package.
