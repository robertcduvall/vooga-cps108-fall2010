<p>Primarily keeps track of read-only game data loaded from XML files and 
readable/writable data stored in databases. Secondarily provides functionality 
for more repeatable random number generation and access to the current real 
world time.</p>

<p>The Resources class parses XML documents to retrieve Images, Animations, Sounds, 
Integers, Doubles, and Strings. These are stored in maps and retrievable using a 
string key. An example XML document can be found in the 
src.examples.resource.resourcesxmlexample package for formatting concerns. The 
Resources class also allows for adding Resources on an individual basis. Finally, 

<p>Real world time is kept using the static WorldClock class which allows for setting a 
local time zone and determining the time at that time zone as well as individual 
components of time ranging from the current millisecond to the current year. These 
times are also available in UTC/system time. This allows for the game to change based 
on real world variables such as time of day or time of year. <br>@see WorldClock</p>


<p>Importation of data is performed using the DataHandler class.  The DataHandler class is abstract and acts as a template for a data loading subclass.  It contains a Data HashMap<String, Object> and methods that assist with importing data as well as an abstract load method.  When creating his or her data handling class which extends DataHandler, one must implement the method load(...), in which one loads data from a file by adding new records to the hashmap.  Since the map is generically typed, one can have any sort of object correspond to a string representing what data is stored in that object.  The resulting object charData could then be placed into the Data hashmap with the call CreateDataField(�Characters�, charData) and retrieved with getData(�Characters�).  DataHandler includes helper methods for parsing different formats such as arbitrarily delimited spreadsheets and XML files.<br>@see DataHandler</p>

HighScoreHandler is a class that deals with data that must be both accessed and written.  In a future release, the API will include a systematic way to interface with a database, but the high score list feature is a common enough one to warrant its own class.  This class, which initialized, creates a highscores table in the desired database file if one does not already exist and populates it with zeros.  The list can be maintained at any length desired.  The updateScores(...) method checks whether an input score belongs on the list and adds it if it does (while removing the previous lowest entry).  The list of scores, their corresponding player names, and the time at which the score was set can be retrieved from the class with the getScores(), getNames(), and getTimes() accessor methods.<br>@HighScoreHandler

<p>All random number handling for the game should be handled using the static Randomizer 
class. Randomizer is based on the java.util.Random class and has all of the same 
functionality plus the ability to store and reset seeds in order to facilitate replays.
All random numbers in a game that might require exact replication in order to replay 
should be generated using this class. Random numbers which do not require exact 
replication, such as aesthetic or particle effects, can also be generated with this 
class using secondary random paths.<br>@Randomizer<p>

<p>Image and Sound handling should be handled by the ResourceManager class. The static classes ImageHandler and SoundHandler maintain two maps of Images/Animations and filepaths for sounds, respectively. Classes that need to load and store image and sound files should, in the initialization method in their main "GameManager" class (or whichever contains the main method) use the loadFile() methods of ImageHandler andSoundHandler to load the respective text files into the Handlers to construct mappings of String "keys" to Object (Image, Animation) or sound filepath "values". Whenever a certain resource is needed by, say, a GameState, all the class needs to do is call the ImageHandler or SoundHandler's getMapping() method to retrieve the resource.<br>@see ImageHandler , SoundHandler</p>
