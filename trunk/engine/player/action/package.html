The package is basically two enhancements to the ways Greenfoot (and most game engines in general) reperesent participants in a game.
<br />
<br />
First, we created a Player that acts as an extension of Greenfoot's actor class. It inherits all of the convenience methods of the Actor class (rotating, setting location, act method called each iteration of the run loop, etc.), but we also added state that most players in a game share like lives, score, item cache, etc.  This makes it much more convenient for the programmer to record and access these common attributes.  We also made an Item class which is basically a way for the programmer to create power-ups, weapons, etc. that appear in the world that a Player can pick up and possibly use.  If the programmer uses the Item class, there are methods built in to our Player/Item classes that make it easy for the Player to store items and use them when they want to.
<br />
<br />
The other main part of our API is the Control class, which accepts a variety of options for an input (eg. keyboard, mouse, AI, network) and calls some predetermined action based on when events occur within that input. The Control class takes one or more players to call these actions on.  This way a Player can easily take input from multiple sources (eg. keyboard and network) while we also abstract the actual detection and callbacks of events from the programmer.  This class takes advantage of Java's Reflection logic to register a method to be called on a certain class whenever an event of the programmer's choice occurs.
<br />
<br />
The Control, Player, and Item classes will be closed from modification, so programmers will have to extend them to take advantage of them.
