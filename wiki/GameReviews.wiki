#summary Discuss each API in context of trying to create a coherent design.

= Introduction =

For each game listed below, your team should review its own game and the next game alphabetically. Your review should focus on how the game can be improved (or simplified) by using the VOOGA (or GTGE) APIs. The comments should generally be constructive in helping us to build a consensus API platform on which to build more complex games. Your review should include the entire game, not just the one class that extends Game.
