#summary Discuss each Game in context of trying to create a coherent design.

= Introduction =

For each game listed below, your team should review its own game and the next game alphabetically. Your review should focus on how the game can be improved (or simplified) by using the VOOGA (or GTGE) APIs. The comments should generally be constructive in helping us to build a consensus API platform on which to build more complex games. Your review should include the entire game, not just the one class that extends Game.

== Tron ==
  Overall, the Tron doesn't utilize many APIs in Vooga while it relies on GTGE to handle collision, player, resources and level. For the APIs in Vooga, the game only used the userInputEvent in event system to handle user input such as down, up ,right and left. The userInputEvent could be improved by allowing game developer to customize their keys. Using Overlay is also important because the game might allow player to choose whether it is one player or two player game. Since the game didn't use that much outside resouces such as pictures and sounds, it might not be necessary to use resources API.
  * combine level system to handle level.
  * add something like overlay or GUI in order for the player to choose game mode such as player vs PC and player vs player.

== Zombieland ==

Overall the Zombieland game is nicely designed and it has pretty graphics and animations. However right now it is not using any of the API's. Therefore potentially it can integrate the game with more API's. Since this game already has a lot of pictures, it can put them in the resource manager. Also the level manager and player managers can be properly added. Another issue right now is that the zombies come towards the player in all directions, while the player can only shoot at straight up/down/left/right directions, which makes it very hard to actually shoot any zombies coming at the player. Hence it would be nice if the player could be able to turn around in any angle and shoot the zombies.
