The high-level design goal of our project was to provide a basic template
for game developers to read and load in "Levels", which are a collection of Sprite images and positions. Also,
the developers should be able to store all of these Levels in a collection.

<p>
In order to add new features to this template, the developer would need to create sub-classes
that represent different types of levels. These levels would extend the Level class, but would
contain new methods that would differentiate themselves from a normal level.
For instance, if the developer wanted to develop a scrolling level, the developer would
have to make that as a new subclass that extended Level.

<p>
One assumption we made was that all level initialization files store Sprite
details in the following format:
<PRE>
SpriteImageFile, x-coordinate, y-coordinate.
</PRE>
Also, the level initialization files are named levelX.txt or levelX.TXT,
where 'X' denotes the index of the level.
